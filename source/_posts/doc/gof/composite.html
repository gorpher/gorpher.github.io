<BODY>

<H2>Intent</H2>
<P>Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.</P>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL><LI>Clients use the Component class interface to interact with objects in
the composite structure. If the recipient is a Leaf, then the request
is handled directly.  If the recipient is a Composite, then it usually
forwards requests to its child components, possibly performing
additional operations before and/or after forwarding.</LI></UL>

<H3>Participants</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Component</B> (Graphic)<P></P>
<UL><LI>declares the interface for objects in the composition.</LI><P></P>
<LI>implements default behavior for the interface
    common to all classes, as appropriate.</LI><P></P>
<LI>declares an interface for accessing and managing its child
    components.</LI><P></P>
<LI>(optional) defines an interface for accessing a component's
    parent in the recursive structure, and implements it if that's
    appropriate.</LI></UL><P></P>

<LI><B>Leaf</B> (Rectangle, Line, Text, etc.)<P></P>
<UL><LI>represents leaf objects in the composition. A leaf has no
    children.</LI><P></P>
<LI>defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition.</LI></UL><P></P>

<LI><B>Composite</B> (Picture)<P></P>
<UL><LI>defines behavior for components having children.</LI><P></P>
<LI>stores child components.</LI><P></P>
<LI>implements child-related operations in the Component interface.</LI></UL><P></P>

<LI><B>Client</B><P></P>
<UL><LI>manipulates objects in the composition through the
    Component interface.</LI></UL>
