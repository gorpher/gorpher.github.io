<BODY>

<H2>Intent</H2>
<P>Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem
easier to use.</P>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Clients communicate with the subsystem by sending requests to Facade,
which forwards them to the appropriate subsystem object(s).  Although
the subsystem objects perform the actual work, the facade may have to
do work of its own to translate its interface to subsystem
interfaces.</LI><P></P>
<LI>Clients that use the facade don't have to access its subsystem objects
directly.</LI>
</UL>

    references to it.</LI></UL>

<H2>Classification</H2>
<P>The Facade design pattern is not known by another name.</P>
