<H2>Intent</H2>

<p>Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. 
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring 
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction 
independently.</p>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Colleagues send and receive requests from a Mediator object. 
The mediator implements the cooperative behavior by routing 
requests between the appropriate colleague(s).</LI>
</UL>
