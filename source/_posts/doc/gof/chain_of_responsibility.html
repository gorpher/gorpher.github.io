<HEAD><TITLE>Chain of Responsibility</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H2>Intent</H2>
<P>Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
than one object a chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request along the chain until an object
handles it.</P>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL>
<LI>When a client issues a request, the request propagates along the chain
until a ConcreteHandler object takes responsibility for handling it.
</UL>
