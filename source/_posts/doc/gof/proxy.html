<H2>Intent</H2>
<P>Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it.</P>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Proxy forwards requests to RealSubject when appropriate,
depending on the kind of proxy.</LI>

<UL>
<LI><B>Proxy</B> (ImageProxy)</LI><P></P>
<UL><LI>maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the
    real subject.  Proxy may refer to a Subject if the
    RealSubject and Subject interfaces are the same.</LI><P></P>
<LI>provides an interface identical to Subject's so that a proxy can
    by substituted for the real subject.</LI><P></P>
<LI>controls access to the real subject and may be responsible for
    creating and deleting it.</LI><P></P>
<LI>other responsibilities depend on the kind of proxy:</LI><P></P>

<UL><LI><EM>remote proxies</EM> are responsible for encoding a
        request and its arguments and for sending the encoded request to
        the real subject in a different address space.</LI><P></P>
<LI><EM>virtual proxies</EM> may cache additional information
        about the real subject so that they can postpone accessing it.
        For example, the ImageProxy from the Motivation caches
        the real image's extent.</LI><P></P>
<LI><EM>protection proxies</EM> check that the caller has the
        access permissions required to perform a request.</LI></UL>
</UL><P></P>

<LI><B>Subject</B> (Graphic)<P></P>
<UL><LI>defines the common interface for RealSubject and
    Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a
    RealSubject is expected.</LI></UL><P></P>

<LI><B>RealSubject</B> (Image)<P></P>
<UL><LI>defines the real object that the proxy represents.</LI></UL>
</UL>

<H2>Classification</H2>
<P>The Proxy design pattern is also known as the Surrogate.</P>
