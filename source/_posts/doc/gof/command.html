<H2>Intent</H2>
<P>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize
clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.</P>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The client creates a ConcreteCommand object and specifies its receiver.</LI><P></P>
<LI>An Invoker object stores the ConcreteCommand object.</LI><P></P>
<LI>The invoker issues a request by calling Execute on the command.  When
commands are undoable, ConcreteCommand stores state for undoing the
command prior to invoking Execute.</LI><P></P>
<LI>The ConcreteCommand object invokes operations on its receiver to carry
out the request.</LI></UL>
