<H2>Intent</H2>
<P>Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.</P>

<H2>Solution Overview</H2>

<UL>
<LI>ConcreteSubject notifies its observers whenever a change
occurs that could make its observers' state inconsistent with its own.</LI><P></P>

<LI>After being informed of a change in the concrete subject, a
ConcreteObserver object may query the subject for information.
ConcreteObserver uses this information to reconcile its state with that
of the subject.</LI>
</UL>

<LI><B>ConcreteObserver</B><P></P>
<UL><LI>maintains a reference to a ConcreteSubject object.<P><!-- extra space --></P>
<LI>stores state that should stay consistent with the subject's.<P><!-- extra space --></P>
<LI>implements the Observer updating interface to keep
    its state consistent with the subject's.</UL>

<H2>Classification</H2>
<P>The Observer design pattern is also known as the Dependents, and the Publish-Subscribe.</P>
